# Juxprose-Elements-Starter-Files

## Scratch Files to begin a web project

This is a very basic set of starter files for a web project. It's based around the structures found in HTML5 Boilerplate (http://html5boilerplate.com) and other best practices picked up here and there.

It will be added to every now and then, to include grid options, microformats and other useful style and structure patterns.
